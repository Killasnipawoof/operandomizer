# Operandomizer
A Discord bot to randomly select an operator from "Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Siege".

## Setup
To use this bot, you will need to create a file `config.json` which contains the following:

```json
{
    "token" : "your bot auth token",
    "ownerID" : "your user ID token",
    "prefix" : "command prefix (recommend '!')",
    "selection" : "operator selection message (e.g., 'I recommend you play')"
}
```

Certain commands are restricted (e.g., `prefix`, which allows a user to change the command prefix) to only the user with the user ID matching the contents of `config.ownerID`.

Additionally, you must install dependencies with `npm install`.

## Commands
The following is a table of commands and help text.
Note that commands that take `CTUs` (Optional) as an argument can be given `default` as a CTU, which specifies all of the default CTUs.
