# Operandomizer
A Discord bot to randomly select an operator from "Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six:
  Siege".

## Adding this bot to your server
I have deployed this bot to a free-tier Heroku account.
To add this bot to your server, visit
`https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=439500818320719882&scope=bot`.

Note that a free-tier Heroku account only receives 550 hours (approx. 21 days)
  of uptime per month.

## Forking this project
After cloning this repository (or a fork of it), to use this bot locally you
  will need to create `config.json` which contains the following:

```json
{
    "token" : "your bot auth token",
    "ownerID" : "your user ID token",
    "prefix" : "command prefix (e.g., '!')",
    "selection" : "operator selection message (e.g., 'I recommend you play')"
}
```

Certain commands are restricted (e.g., `prefix`, which allows a user to change
  the command prefix) to only the user with the user ID matching the contents
  of `config.ownerID`.

Additionally, you must install dependencies with `npm install`.

The bot can then be started with `node bot.js`.

## Commands
The following is a table of commands and help text.
Note that commands that take `CTUs` (Optional) as an argument can be given
  `default` as a CTU, which specifies all of the default CTUs.

| Command | Arguments | Text |

| `ping`  | N/A       | Reply in the same channel with `pong!`
| `prefix`| `newPrefix` | Change the command prefix to match `newPrefix`
| `atk`   | CTU code(s) (Optional) | Reply in the same channel with the name of a random Attack operator selected from the given CTUs (or from all CTUs if none are specified)
| `def`   | CTU code(s) (Optional) | Reply in the same channel with the name of a random Defense operator selected from the given CTUs (or from all CTUs if none are specified)
